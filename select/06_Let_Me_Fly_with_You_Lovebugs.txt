I wake from dreams of you
And find that they're all coming true
You are lying next to me
There's no greater fortune free
In your arms so dear

There's no sorrow and there's no fear
Drift off to a distant land
We'll be dancing hand in hand
Making love on golden sand

Let me fly with you
On wings of love with you
I'll make your every wish come true
Just let me fly with you

Morning light shines through
Into the window onto you
You take my breath away
Living this dream day for day
Forever i hope and pray

Let me fly with you
On wings of love with you
I'll make your every wish come true
Just let me fly with you
