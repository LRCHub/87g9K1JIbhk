I just want to live my life with no regret
I just want to fall in love with someone I just met
I want to end my night in someone else's bed
I want to wake up forgetting what I said
I want to ride ride ride ride ride with you
I want to fly fly fly fly fly with you
I want to ride ride ride ride ride with you
I want to fly fly with you
I can't explain it no no no
Seasons changing ooh oh oh oh
I think you better off I think you better off
Im done explaining
Don't remember what I said
Don't remember what I said
I just want to live my life with no regret
I just want to fall in love with someone I just met
I want to end my night in someone else's bed
I want to wake up forgetting what I said
I want to ride ride ride ride ride with you
I want to fly fly fly fly fly with you
I want to ride ride ride ride ride with you
I want to fly fly with you
